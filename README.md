# Sorting Hogwarts Newbies


## Description
This project is an exploration into using event listeners, forms, and dynamically printing content to the page. It also introduces the use of auto-generated random IDs and color-coding new objects in an array as well as the ability to remove items from the array dynamically. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/EVENTS_sorting_hat.md).
